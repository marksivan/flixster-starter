Flixster is a movie discovery web application that lets users browse, search, and explore current films using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Users can view movie details in a pop-up modal, sort results by title, release date, or rating, and manage personal lists by marking movies as favorites or watched. The app features embedded trailers, a sidebar for easy navigation between Home, Favorites, and Watched pages.
